Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or an offence punishable on summary conviction. Hatred is predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society. Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation. The Ontario Court of Appeal has also interpreted the meaning of \"willfully\" in the context of the intention of promoting hatred.

Hatred means \"active dislike, detestation, enmity, ill-will, malevolence.\" Justice Rooke in Re: Kane expanded this definition and stated that hatred is: a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one \"hates\" another means in effect that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. It is a term, however, which does not necessarily involve the mental process of \"looking down\" on another or others. It is quite possible to \"hate\" someone who one feels is superior to one in intelligence, wealth or power. Some of the factors that courts and human rights tribunals examine to answer the above questions are the: content of the communication; tone of the communication; image conveyed, including whether the use of quotations, references and sources give the message more credibility; vulnerability of the target group; degree to which the expression reinforces existing stereotypes; circumstances surrounding the message, including whether the message appeals to well publicized issues; medium used to convey the message; circulation of the publication; credibility to be accorded to the communication; and context of publication, for example, whether it is part of a debate or whether it is presented as news, or as a purportedly authoritative analysis. The main focus of this analysis is not the intent of the person distributing the statement, but rather the nature of the message and the effect the statement has on another individual or group. Indeed, discrimination may be found even when the person publishing or distributing the statement had no intention to discriminate. It is whether a reasonable person would be persuaded that individuals or groups are more likely to be exposed to hatred or contempt based on the protected grounds because of the distributed statement.\" Protected groups include ['Marital status', 'Religion/Religious beliefs', 'Race (colour, creed)', 'Sex/Gender identity or expression', 'Age', 'Source of income', 'Family status', 'Sexual orientation', 'Physical or mental disability', 'National or ethnic origin (nationality, ethnicity, ancestry)']Post: Did he kill your sex life?
