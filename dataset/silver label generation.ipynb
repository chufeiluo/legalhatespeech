I would prefer to not even know that but my father wanted to be sure that I would be ok with him having another kid, me being an only child. It is fine by me, whatever. My parents divorced when I was 5 but they never hate each other at all. They actually always had a very good relationship, as far as I can remember. My mom also likes Laura and has no problem with her being with my dad. So, yesterday, my mom (41F) was picking me up at my dad\\'s house and Laura invited her in to have tea. They started talking about Laura trying to get pregnant. I wanted to go home and was disgusted listening my mother talking about something related to sex but I tolerated it at first. I was looking at my phone as if I was not paying attention but couldn\\'t avoid it. I started complaining that I wanted to go home but my mom told me that she was going to talk to Laura as long as she wanted and that if I didn\\'t like it I could wait in my room or go home on my own. That was the worst because then I could not go to my room without looking like a little kid doing what she told me to in front of Laura so I had to stay. My breaking point was when my mom asked Laura how many times my dad and her were \"doing it\" and she said at least once a day. My mom asked if my dad was using viagra or something but Laura smiled and said that he doesn\\'t need it. I got very angry and started yelling. I told my mom that she is too old to talk about stuff like that and that she was being disgusting asking those questions. She apologised to Laura \"on my behalf\" and left without taking me home. I think it was very rude of her to do that. Today, she has been totally ignoring me as if she is still angry.

The coffee pot was causing a lot of coffee grounds to let loose in the brewed coffee and I asked her about it thinking it needed to be clean or something. Not really a coffee drinkers but I do enjoy it on occasion. She says the coffee machine needs to be cleaned or run through a few cycles. She takes my cup and attempts to get the coffee grounds out with a spoon, but there's a lot in there and I'm kind of grossed out by it so I tell her to toss it out. She insists it's okay and that she just takes out the coffee grounds and drinks it. She's very difficult at times and keeps insisting I drink the coffee so I don't waste it. I tell her no and she keeps insisting otherwise saying it's fine. she then goes to attempt to clean out the coffee machine by running water through it, causing water to spill all over the floor making a mess. I grab a towel that we use to dry off the dog if it's raining outside to clean the water off the floor. I guess this is gross to her and she says I should use my brain before grabbing the disgusting dog towel to clean the water off the kitchen counter (I was going to use it on the floor, not the kitchen counter). She wouldn't let me wipe the water off the floor with the dog towel and grabs a clean new towel to wipe water off the counters and floor. I tell her I grabbed this towel because it was already dirty and I'm wiping water off a dirty floor. That's just how my mind works I guess but she makes unnecessary comments when I'm just trying to help clean up. I get a bit upset at this point and let her know she didn't need to clean the coffee pot at this moment, I just wasn't sure what was in my cup as I'm not a everyday coffee drinker and I was just trying to help. I leave at that point a bit angry and get told I'm making the situation a bigger deal than it needs to be, even though I'm just trying to help clean up the mess she's making.

I don\\'t respect Christians who hate gay people, and I refuse to respect anyone else who does for any reason. Sexuality is largely a moral issue. Who and when sex is permissible by. You\\'re free to call it homophobia, but many people call it just morally wrong. If you have problems with people who don\\'t agree with homosexuality, you have problems with large portions of the world. As I said, I\\'m around a lot of Africans, and they just are from a culture where it\\'s considered wrong. A guy I work with is from Ethiopia, he tells me what it\\'s like there. Look up the laws on homosexuality there. It\\'s interesting to see what people are like from places I\\'ll never get a chance to go to. It\\'s intriguing. He calls himself \\'orthodox Christian\\', not just Christian, but orthodox Christian. He\\'ll never refer to his Christianity with using the word orthodox first. Turns out, that\\'s how it is where he\\'s from. <url> I understand your morals say homosexuality is ok. But just understand not everyone shares your sense of morality. Since you\\'re talking about this, I have one question for you. What should the USA do about immigrants? We get people from Africa, they come from places where they\\'ve been instilled to believe being gay is wrong. Meaning, their morality is they believe it\\'s wrong. They come here, and see it\\'s accepted, but they still believe it\\'s wrong. You can\\'t expect them to change their morality, any more than you would change your morality if you moved to Africa.

The \"adult\" thing to do would be to remove yourself from the conversation. You had multiple options about leaving and didn\\'t want to because you didn\\'t want to look like you were doing what your mom said. Childish. Second, sex is a common part of adult life, and conversation, regardless of age. The older you get, the more separated from the puritanical ideas of sex as a taboo that has been ingrained in you when you were a child. It\\'s not weird or inappropriate to talk about sex, especially two women discussing getting pregnant. Adults talk about sex. Your mom doesn\\'t have some special status that she can\\'t talk about kids because she\\'s a mom or \"too old\". What you said was hurtful and immature. You are absolutely valid to feel uncomfortable about sex, but not to enforce it on others, especially not when you\\'re trying to enforce some weirdass age limit to sex. There was no reason you had to be apart of that conversation. Again, when mature adults are uncomfortable or don\\'t want to be apart of a conversation, they leave. Thirdly, you acted like a child. You were mean to your mom. Straight up asshole. You called her old, you yelled at her and threw a weird tantrum because you didn\\'t like their conversation. You were purposely hurtful and aggressive in order to get your way. That\\'s what children do. Seriously seriously apologize to both your mom and Laura, and reflect on the way you behaved and the way it affected others.

My (31F) parents\\' friends have two daughters. The younger one (will call her \"L\") and I are the same age and have always been really close. When L was 18 she got into a huge fight with her dad (based on him favouring her sister their) which resulted in her moving away and cutting all contact with her whole family. Since our families are close, in the beginning I often saw L\\'s parents and her mom always asked me for updates about her daughter which I gave her ( L was fine with that). She tears up every time L is mentioned. Eventually I moved alway and now when I come back home I only hang out with my family. The last time I saw L\\'s mom I told her she had moved to France. This was 11 years ago. Since then L has gotten married and has 4 children (7M, 5M, 2M, 7moF). My parents\\' anniversary was last week, we had a dinner and L\\'s family was invited. This was the first time I\\'ve seen them in over a decade. L\\'s mom asked about her and I told her about the husband and the kids. She started crying. Even L\\'s father and sister who have pretended she doesn\\'t exist for the past 13 years got visibly emotional when they learned they have grandkids/nephews. Her mom begged me for L\\'s number because she really wanted to call her and try to meet her only grandkids. I told her I would ask L if she was okay with it first. Well L was definitely not okay with it. She asked me not to share her number or pictures of the kids with her family and that she isn\\'t interested in rebuilding the relationship. I respected her wishes but her mom has been calling me, begging me for her phone number since this is the only way she can reach her daughter (L doesn\\'t have social media). I should add that the initial conflict that caused L to walk alway from her family was between her, her sister and their dad but she has cut everyone off, including her mom for not backing her up. Her mom wants to apologise and has tried to reach her in the past (unsuccessfully) but when L moved to France she changed her number. AITA for refusing to give a heartbroken mother an opportunity to reach her daughter even when she cries and begs me to? My parents suggested giving her the number, saying that L can always just not pick up the phone.

OP, you are a self-absorbed individual that needs to recognize your child's needs over your own. It doesn't matter that the kid was okay later. It would have mattered that, given the opportunity to demonstrate to your child that parents in different homes are still united in their value of the children and the family unit, the child was allowed to see his mother if he chose. You didn't give a choice because you were to consumed with demonstrating the control you had over the situation. If you can learn to foster good relations with the children's mother, especially in times like these where the child obviously needed that consolation, you will create strong bonds with your children that will last a lifetime. If you can't get out of your own way and gain some ground on this, the relationship you want with your children as they become adults could be more distant than you might expect. And, unfortunately, you would deserve every bit of heartbreak because you couldn't view the relationship with your children with and longevity in mind.

I'm not just referring to dating, but just the lack of support that a lot of young men face. I think we as a society have rightfully tried to give young women more support, but have forgotten to do the same for our young men.

Why is he blaming YOU for making MIL \"feel bad\" about completely betraying your trust and right to privacy? Again, this could be answered by your answer to the question above. -Lastly, are you sure you want this?

      "CC_318 states \"Every person who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years. In this section, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part any identifiable group, namely, killing members of the group; or deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction. An intent to directly prompt or provoke another person to commit genocide is enough to establish the mens rea of the offence.\" Protected groups include colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mental or physical disability\n",
      "CC_319 states \"Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or an offence punishable on summary conviction. Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or an offence punishable on summary conviction. Hatred is predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society. Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation. The Ontario Court of Appeal has also interpreted the meaning of “willfully” in the context of the intention of promoting hatred. It does not include recklessness but includes the intention that encompasses the means as well as the final objective. A person intended a consequence if he foresaw that it was certain or substantially certain to result from an act he committed in order to achieve some other purposes.\" Protected groups include colour, race, religion, national or ethnic origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, mental or physical disability\n",
      "HR_AB states \"No person shall publish, issue or display or cause to be published, issued or displayed before the public any statement, publication, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation that indicates discrimination or an intention to discriminate against a person or a class of persons, or is likely to expose a person or a class of persons to hatred or contempt because of the protected groups of that person or class of persons. Hatred means \"active dislike, detestation, enmity, ill-will, malevolence.\" Justice Rooke in Re: Kane expanded this definition and stated that hatred is: a set of emotions and feelings which involve extreme ill will towards another person or group of persons. To say that one \"hates\" another means in effect that one finds no redeeming qualities in the latter. It is a term, however, which does not necessarily involve the mental process of \"looking down\" on another or others. It is quite possible to \"hate\" someone who one feels is superior to one in intelligence, wealth or power. Some of the factors that courts and human rights tribunals examine to answer the above questions are the: content of the communication; tone of the communication; image conveyed, including whether the use of quotations, references and sources give the message more credibility; vulnerability of the target group; degree to which the expression reinforces existing stereotypes; circumstances surrounding the message, including whether the message appeals to well publicized issues; medium used to convey the message; circulation of the publication; credibility to be accorded to the communication; and context of publication, for example, whether it is part of a debate or whether it is presented as news, or as a purportedly authoritative analysis. The main focus of this analysis is not the intent of the person distributing the statement, but rather the nature of the message and the effect the statement has on another individual or group. Indeed, discrimination may be found even when the person publishing or distributing the statement had no intention to discriminate. It is whether a reasonable person would be persuaded that individuals or groups are more likely to be exposed to hatred or contempt based on the protected grounds because of the distributed statement.\" Protected groups include race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, physical disability, mental disability, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, source of income, family status, sexual orientation\n",
      "HR_BC states \"A person must not publish, issue or display, or cause to be published, issued or displayed, any statement, publication, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation that indicates discrimination or an intention to discriminate against a person or a group or class of persons, or is likely to expose a person or a group or class of persons to hatred or contempt because of the Indigenous identity, race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or age of that person or that group or class of persons.\" Protected groups include Indigenous identity, race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age\n",
      "HR_NW states \"No person shall, on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination, publish or display or cause or permit to be published or displayed any statement, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation that expresses or implies discrimination or any intention to discriminate against any individual or class of individuals; incites or is calculated to incite others to discriminate against any individual or class of individuals; or is likely to expose any individual or class of individuals to hatred or contempt. For the purposes of this Act, the prohibited grounds of discrimination are race,  colour, ancestry, nationality, ethnic origin, place of origin, creed, religion, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, family affiliation, political belief, political association, social condition conviction that is subject to a pardon or record suspension.\" Protected groups include race, colour, ancestry, nationality, ethnic origin, place of origin, creed, religion, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, family status, family affiliation, political belief, political association, social condition, conviction that is subject to a pardon or record suspension\n",
      "HR_SA states \"No person shall publish or display, or cause or permit to be published or displayed, before the public any statement, publication, notice, sign, symbol, emblem or other representation: tending or likely to tend to deprive, abridge or otherwise restrict the enjoyment by any person or class of persons, on the basis of a prohibited ground, of any right to which that person or class of persons is entitled under the law; or that exposes or tends to expose to hatred any person or class of persons on the basis of a prohibited ground. Nothing in subsection (1) restricts the right to freedom of expression under the law on any subject.\" Protected groups include religion, creed, marital status, family status, sex, sexual orientation, disability, age, colour, ancestry, nationality, place of origin, race or perceived race, receipt of public assistance, gender identity\n",
      "TOS_MET states \"We define attacks as: violent or dehumanizing speech, harmful stereotypes, statements of inferiority, expressions of contempt, disgust or dismissal, cursing and calls for exclusion or segregation. We also prohibit the use of harmful stereotypes, which we define as dehumanizing comparisons that have historically been used to attack, intimidate, or exclude specific groups, and that are often linked with offline violence.\" Protected groups include race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, serious disease\n",
      "TOS_RED states \"While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect those who promote attacks of hate or who try to hide their hate in bad faith claims of discrimination. Communities and people that incite violence or that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\" Protected groups include actual and perceived race, colour, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy or disability, victims of a major event and their families\n",
      "TOS_TK states \"We define hate speech or behavior as content that attacks, threatens, incites violence against, or otherwise dehumanizes an individual or a group on the basis of the following protected attributes\" Protected groups include Race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, serious disease, disability, immigration status\n",
      "TOS_TWT states \"Hateful conduct: You may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease.
