Throwaway account for obvious reasons. &#x200B; I(23f) have a horrible grandaunt(50-60) she\\'s the most entitled person I had ever met. When I was 12, I think, she got a dog (his son had a GF who couldn\\'t take care of it anymore). She barely fed it so the dog was always around the table trying to steal food from my great grandfather, who was also starving so he kicked it when my aunt didn\\'t see it. She didn\\'t take it for a walk, she just opened the door to her house let the dog out so the dog could run around the park next to her house, and at some point, the dog got sick, my greataunt took it to the vet and it turned out that the dog was sicked because my aunt thought bathing it with chlorine would be nice. The vet told her to stop(Believe me, I wish this were lies). I honestly feel bad for the poor dog but, he had bad behaviors all the time but couldn\\'t do anything since I was a child. &#x200B; So the dog is old now (don\\'t know how he managed to be alive for so long), and my grandaunt got a puppy about three months ago. She stole it from a friend who\\'s a vet. They both agree she would pay a monthly amount but when the Vet knocked on her door to get the money she refused saying she already told him she got no money and that the puppy was a gift, the vet then said he wanted the puppy back but my aunt didn\\'t give it to him saying the puppy was already attached to her, vet left with no puppy or money, one week later the puppy was dead, my grandaunt went to the store with the puppy ( no leash) and while she was inside the puppy was hit by a car, she tried to take it to the vet (his friend vet from he had stolen the puppy) but the puppy was badly injured and died. I felt terrible about the situation but thought it was the end of the story. &#x200B; Well... guess who has a new puppy. Yes my grandaunt I\\'m enraged when my mom told me happily about it I SAW RED, I screamed at her for supporting my grandaunt instead of telling her how irresponsible she was being. She said she was sorry but told me that I shouldn\\'t think about it since there was nothing I could do, I didn\\'t tell her anything and changed the subject but I want to do something for that dog so I\\'m planning to gift it to a friend A friend of mine had said that if I can get the dog he would be willing to take it, he\\'s a good person who loves animals and for god saint, he wouldn\\'t bathe him in chlorine. &#x200B; I had told my BF if he would help me and he\\'s trying to change my mind since we could end up getting in trouble but I can\\'t stop thinking about it. So he insisted I post here to see what strangers think about it So WIBTA for gifting the puppy of my grandaunt without her knowledge/permission ????

They can\\'t hold jobs for long and always rely on their family to support them financially. Basically have always leeched off the family and never take accountability or even want to try to become stable adults.

Because he\\'s a dummy and has no sense of remorse or thinks he is invincible, he fled back home to texas where he was caught and extradited to california to serve his jail sentence. Well, he ended up only serving like 70 days and was released for \"good behavior\", but is now on probation for 2 years. His crazy mother flew to California to pick him up from jail, thinking they\\'d only be here for a week while his probation gets transferred to texas. Because no family in California want anything to do with them (with good reason), he decides to use my 87 year old grandmother\\'s address for his probation and now they\\'re staying there with her in her tiny 1 bedroom apartment. He talks about conversations he has with the devil. He sleeps with a knife under the couch cushion he sleeps on because he is paranoid. He has sent death threats to our other cousins. He has stood outside one of those cousins homes watching his family. Like, he is not someone a old little lady should be around.
