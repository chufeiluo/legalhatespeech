Every person who advocates or promotes genocide is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years. 
In this section, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy in whole or in part any identifiable group, namely, killing members of the group; or deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction.
An intent to directly prompt or provoke another person to commit genocide is enough to establish the mens rea of the offence.
