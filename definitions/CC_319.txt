Every one who, by communicating statements in any public place, incites hatred against any identifiable group where such incitement is likely to lead to a breach of the peace is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or an offence punishable on summary conviction. 
Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or an offence punishable on summary conviction.
Communicating includes communicating by telephone, broadcasting or other audible or visible means; 
Public place includes any place to which the public have access as of right or by invitation, express or implied; 
Statements includes words spoken or written or recorded electronically or electro-magnetically or otherwise, and gestures, signs or other visible representations.
Hatred is further defined by the Supreme Court of Canada in cases like R v Keegstra. 
Hatred is predicated on destruction, and hatred against identifiable groups therefore thrives on insensitivity, bigotry and destruction of both the target group and of the values of our society. Hatred in this sense is a most extreme emotion that belies reason; an emotion that, if exercised against members of an identifiable group, implies that those individuals are to be despised, scorned, denied respect and made subject to ill-treatment on the basis of group affiliation. 
The Ontario Court of Appeal has also interpreted the meaning of “willfully” in the context of the intention of promoting hatred. It does not include recklessness but includes the intention that encompasses the means as well as the final objective. 
"A person intended a consequence if he foresaw that it was certain or substantially certain to result from an act he committed in order to achieve some other purposes".
